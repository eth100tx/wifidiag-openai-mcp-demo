# WiFi Diagnostics Troubleshooting Prompt

## üîß **Comprehensive WiFi Diagnosis Request**

I'm experiencing WiFi connectivity issues and need a complete diagnostic analysis. Please help me troubleshoot by running through the following WiFi diagnostic functions in this order:

### **Step 1: Initial WiFi Status Check**
Please run `check_wifi_status` to analyze:
- Current WiFi adapter status and power state
- Available network profiles and configurations  
- Driver version and hardware information
- Connection state (connected/disconnected)

### **Step 2: Network Connectivity Analysis**
Please run `diagnose_connection_issues` to check:
- IP configuration and DHCP settings
- Internet connectivity tests (ping, HTTPS)
- DNS resolution functionality
- Gateway and routing information

### **Step 3: Authentication & Certificate Review**
Please run `check_authentication_issues` to examine:
- Recent WiFi authentication events and failures
- Certificate expiration status (within 30 days)
- Saved network profile details and security settings
- Historical connection/disconnection patterns

### **Step 4: WiFi Environment Analysis**
Please run `analyze_wifi_environment` to assess:
- Available networks and signal strengths in area
- Current signal quality and interference
- WiFi adapter advanced driver settings
- Channel and frequency band configurations

### **Step 5: Comprehensive Report Generation**
Please run `generate_diagnostic_report` to create:
- Complete diagnostic summary with timestamps
- Automated issue detection and analysis
- Windows built-in WiFi report generation
- Consolidated findings from all diagnostic functions

## üìã **Additional Context to Consider:**

**My Current Situation:**
- WiFi connection status: [Connected/Disconnected/Intermittent]
- Specific problems: [No internet, slow speeds, frequent drops, can't connect]
- Recent changes: [New router, Windows updates, driver changes]
- Error messages seen: [Describe any specific error messages]

**Environment Details:**
- Number of devices on network: [Approximate count]
- Router/modem type: [Brand/model if known]
- Physical location: [Home/office, building materials, distance from router]

## üîß **If Issues Are Found:**

After the initial diagnosis, if problems are detected, please also consider running:

`fix_common_issues` to attempt automatic resolution of:
- WiFi adapter resets
- DNS cache clearing
- IP address renewal
- Network stack resets (requires admin privileges)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: The fix function will make actual changes to network settings. Please confirm before running if you want me to attempt automated fixes.

## üìä **Desired Analysis:**

Please provide:
1. **Summary of findings** - What's working vs. what's not
2. **Root cause analysis** - Most likely cause of connectivity issues  
3. **Prioritized recommendations** - Steps to resolve issues
4. **Performance insights** - Signal strength, speed, stability
5. **Security assessment** - Network security posture
6. **Preventive measures** - How to avoid future issues

## üéØ **Specific Questions I Have:**

- Is my WiFi adapter functioning properly?
- Are there any authentication or certificate issues?
- What's the signal quality and interference level?
- Are there any network configuration problems?
- Should I update drivers or change settings?
- Are there any security concerns with my WiFi setup?
